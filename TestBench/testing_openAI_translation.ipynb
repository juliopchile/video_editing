       "\"Let's see what themes pop up. This is the dream day where I'm the champ.\\nSo sorry, kid, apologize. You're heir to the throne, but as long as I'm alive, the crown is mine.\\nSo don't talk to me, bro, you're done. 'Cause in the end, you ain't making noise.\\nNo clue why the scene backs you. If you're like Jesus, the only ‘good night’ you had was Christmas Eve.\\nSeriously, I'm here to leave your body cold. You're nervous and you can't even convince yourself.\\nBad weed never dies and they can't take me out, 'cause I'm Héctor Lavoe and this is “El Día de Mi Suerte.”\\nIt’s that simple: my rhymes are never basic. I've been spitting from the gutter, watch how they shine. This isn't your dream day, with me it's your nightmare.\\n‘Nightmare’—I'm chill, in fact I'm about to beat you right here nice and calm.\\nI'm not up at night from stress. I can't sleep anymore because I'm living the dream.\\nWhat are you talking to me about the day for? The truth is you ain't all that.\\nIs it your lucky day when you're freestyling? That day hasn't come, so you better keep dreaming.\\nI keep dreaming, and if I dream then I win, 'cause I've truly survived the worst.\\nI swear this is a dream day and I'll shut you up 'cause the codes have declared it so.\\nBetter stay dreaming today, 'cause I've got the code for a premeditated rhyme.\\nWhat does she know if she's not street? I beat the Valle guy, and today I beat the Valle girl.\\n‘I beat Valle girls.’ What do you know 'bout the streets or the curb?\\nI know the codes and I can do it drama-free, 'cause you're Chilean but I'm Colombian.\\nI'm talking about those codes—don't you get it? So this rapper ain't any different to me.\\nI got a bar code in front of the crowd. The product's moving already, so bring on the next one.\\nYeah, you know what a code is? It's dropping these rhymes. Rising from the worst on any stage. 'Cause being street means repping with rhyme. To be street you don't just sell cocaine!\\nIt's that simple! The streets ain't just that, and you ain't never been there, you're just on the flyers.\\nGuess what, I went to your country, I took down every street queen but never saw you.\""
